show info

This command prints general information about vessels in the default group
including the version, nodeID, etc.

Example:
exampleuser@%1 !> show info
192.x.x.178:1224:v3 has no information (try 'update' or 'list')
exampleuser@%1 !> update
exampleuser@%1 !> show info
192.x.x.178:1224:v3 {'nodekey': {'e': 65537L, 'n': 929411623458072017781884599109L}, 'version': '0.1r', 'nodename': '192.x.x.175'}


show ip 
show ip [to file]

This lists the ip addresses of the vessels in the default group.   These IP
addresses may be optionally written to a file.   

Note that machines behind a NAT, mobile devices, or other systems with 
atypical network connectivity may list a host name instead.

Example:
exampleuser@ !> show targets
browsegood ['192.x.x.2:1224:v12', '192.x.x.2:1224:v3', '193.x.x.42:1224:v18', '219.x.x.62:1224:v4']
